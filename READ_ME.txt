I have been unable to build this project, apparently because of some problems in the .json files in the .vscode folder.
I have browsed the internet, looking for answers on how to fix it, but I wasn't able to find much.
Check them before trying to build this project.
Other than that, the CMake should be fine, and the code should be working as intented.

Not all the doxygen has been written out. This will come later.
